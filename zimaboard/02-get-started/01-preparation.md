:::tip

You don't need to connect your mouse and keyboard to the ZimaBoard, you can access all the services on the ZimaBoard directly through the network after connecting cables.

Of course, if you find it more convenient to plug in your monitor, you can also use a miniDP to DP or HDMI cable to connect your monitor, and connect your mouse and keyboard.
