# Wiring and Power On

## Connect Ethernet

<p><img

    display: 'block',
    margin: 'auto'
    }}
/></p>

It is recommended to connect the ZimaBoard to your router or ISP modem through a network cable, refer to this picture

<p><img
  src={require('./images/eth-connection.jpg').default}

  style={{
    maxWidth: '80%',
    display: 'block',
    margin: 'auto'
    }}
/></p>

:::info

If you have multiple routers in your network, make sure to connect the ZimaBoard to your primary router. Or at least to the router at the same level you use to access the device.

In short, just try to connect to the top router!

<summary>Network Details</summary>

**For example, if your network looks like this:**

<p><img
  src={require('./images/network-case-1.png').default}
  alt="Network Case 1"
  style={{
    maxWidth: '80%',
    display: 'block',
    margin: 'auto'
    }}
/></p>

The routers are connected as shown in the diagram. Both router A and router B are connected to different devices that need to be networked, and you want them both to be connected to the ZimaBoard, connect the ZimaBoard to router A.

But if all your devices that need to be networked are actually connected to router B, or if you only want the devices under router B to access the ZimaBoard, then just connect to router B.

**The same goes for the following network situation:**

<p><img
  src={require('./images/network-case-2.png').default}
  alt="Network Case 2"
  style={{
    maxWidth: '80%',
    display: 'block',
    margin: 'auto'
    }}
/></p>

The routers are connected as shown in the figure. Routers A, B, C and D are all connected to different Internet devices, and you want them all to connect to the ZimaBoard, connect the ZimaBoard to router A.

If you only want the devices under router B to access the ZimaBoard, then just connect to router B. At this point, none of the devices connected to routers A and C will be able to access the ZimaBoard.

## Connect HDD/SSD Drive

:::tip 
This step is optional, but it is recommended that you add an external drive to use CasaOS.

## Power On

Plug in the power cable and the power indicator flashes! (ง ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)ง
